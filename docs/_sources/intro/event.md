The [Singapore AI CTF](https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/events/singapore-ai-ctf-2024/) was a jeopardy-style AI/ML Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competition organised by GovTech's Cybersecurity Group (CSG) and Dreadnode. In this competition, participants tackle AI security challenges across 7 domains to collect 'flags' in the form of hidden files or information.

The challenges spanned the following 7 categories:

## Data Analysis

Participants need to utilise various data analysis and visualisation tools to extract hidden information within a given dataset.

## Model Extraction

Participants use malicious means to extract information from the model (e.g. parameters, architecture, or training data)

## Model Fingerprinting

Participants must verify watermarks and/or fingerprints in AI models to verify their authenticity and detect unauthorised copies.

## Prompt Injection

An attack where hackers use a specially crafted input to trick AI into disclosing a hidden secret.

## Adversarial AI Image

An attacker injects malicious data into the training set causing AI to misclassify an image.

## Adversarial Audio Generation

Involves replicating voices and audio using AI.

## Model Inversion

An attacker aims to infer/reconstruct input data based on model outputs.
