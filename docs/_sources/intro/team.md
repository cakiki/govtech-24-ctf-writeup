# The Team

Team team is a 4-person team consisting of:

- [Bilal Alhalabi](https://github.com/bilalalhalabi0)
- [conor-99](https://github.com/conor-99)
- [Christopher Akiki](https://twitter.com/christopher)
- [kenyeungtech](https://github.com/kenyeungtech)

We were the only strictly remote team and relied on a discord server to organize ourselves and commiserate among ourselves the many, MANY times we got stuck.

We finished **6th** (open category and overall) in the qualifying round:

 and **3rd** in the open category (5th overall) with 13 points in the final:
