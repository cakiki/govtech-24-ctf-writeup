# The Writeup

This writeup is structured as a jupyterbook, with most challenge solutions being jupyter notebooks that are meant to be run end-to-end. If you have trouble with any of them, feel free to open an issue and we'll do our best to help you.

We're really happy you're interested in our solutions, but we don't recommend you read them before trying the challenges out yourself on the [crucible platform](https://crucible.dreadnode.io/).
