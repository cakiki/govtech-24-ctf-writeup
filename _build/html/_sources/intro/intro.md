# Singapore AI CTF by GovTech Writeup

This Jupyter Book contains Team Team's writeup for both events of the 2024 Singapore AI CTF that was organized by GovTech and Dreadnode.

We finished 10th in the qualifying round and 3rd in the final in the open category.

We thank Dreadnode and GovTech for organizing one of the most fun AI/ML CTF events in recent memory, and for not bringing back the CIFAR challenge.
